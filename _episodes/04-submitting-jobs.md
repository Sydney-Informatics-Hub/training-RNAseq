In this episode we practice **submitting** and **monitoring** jobs on Artemis. We also explore the different **job queues** available.

## Artemis Job Queues

Artemis' scheduler reserves portions of the cluster for different job types, in order to make access fairer for all users. However, the most commonly used queues are not specified in a resource request, but are allocated automatically based on what resources are requested. These primary queues all fall under the **defaultQ** -- which is also the default queue set for any job that does not specify its queue with a ```-q``` directive.

The queues under **defaultQ** are _small_, _normal_, _large_, _highmem_ and _gpu_. Jobs are allocated to them based according to the resource limits set for each queue; jobs will only run in a queue whose limits it satisfies. Recall that resources are requested with ```-l``` directives. The resource limits for each queue are listed below. Importantly, as soon as GPU resources are requested, jobs are assigned to the GPU queue -- there is no other queue with GPU resources.

| Queue | Invocation | Max Walltime  | Max Cores per<br>Job / User / Node | Memory (GB) per<br>Node / Core | Fair Share Weight |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:---:|:---:|
| -small<br>-normal<br>-large<br>-highmem<br>-gpu  |<br><br>**defaultQ**<br><br>| 1 day<br>7 days<br>21 days<br>21 days<br>7 days  | 24 / 128 / 24<br>96 / 128 / 32 <br>288 / 288 / 32<br>192 / 192 / 64<br>252 / 252 / 36 | 123 / < 20<br>123 / < 20<br>123 / < 20<br>123-6144 / > 20<br>185 / -- | 10<br>10<br>10<br>50<br>50  |   
| small express | **small-express** | 12 hours  | 4 / 40 / 4  | 123 / --  | 50  |   
| scavenger | **scavenger**| 2 days  | 288 / 288 / 24 | 123 / --  | 0 |   
| data transfer | **dtq** | 10 days  | 2 / 16 / 2  | 16 / --  | 0 |   
| interactive | ```qsub -I```  | 4 hours  | 4 / 4 / 4 | 123 / --  | 100 |

Take note of the maxima for each queue. Note especially the _maximum cores per node_: if you request more than this number of CPUs in a ```-l select=``` directive, your job **can never run**. The highest limit for CPU _cores / node_ is 64, as this is the number or cores of the largest CPUs available on Artemis.

Each queue also has a different contribution factor to your _Fair Share_ count. So, eg, use of **small-express** will accumulate Fair Share 50x faster than using the **defaultQ**.

There are also a number of additional queues which are not part of **defaultQ**. These are

| Queue | Purpose |
|:---:|:---|
| small-express | For quick jobs that require few resources. |
| scavenger | Allows jobs to use any idle resources available in other people's _allocations_; however, **your job will be suspended if the allocation owner requests those resoures!**<br>Suspended scavenger jobs will be **killed** after 24 hours. |
| dtq | This queue is reserved for transferring data into or out of Artemis. Users may **not** try to perform computation in these queues, and the system generally won't let you. |
| interactive | This is the queue for _interactive_ jobs. It can only be accessed via a ```qsub -I``` command. |


#### Allocations

**Scavenger** uses idle resources available in _allocations_. An allocation refers to Artemis resources (ie nodes) which have been assigned to certain research groups for priority use. Allocations can be purchased, won, or granted via the [Facilities Access Scheme](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/services/fas/). Remember, your **scavenger** jobs will be _paused_ if the allocation owner requests those resources; they'll be _killed_ if they become paused for longer then 24 hours. This makes **scavenger** an excellent option if you have many small jobs that you can easily re-run if they happen to be killed; some users get thousands of 'free' CPU-hours from scavenging!


## Submitting Jobs

### Adjusting PBS directives

We're now ready to **submit** a compute job to Artemis. Navigate to the **sample data** we extracted, and open **basic.pbs** in your preferred text editor.

~~~
nano basic.pbs
~~~
{: .bash}

<figure>
  <a name="nanobasic"></a>
  <img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/04_nanobasic2.png" style="margin:10px;height:420px"/>
  <figcaption> The <b>basic.pbs</b> PBS script. </figcaption>
</figure><br>

We need to make a few edits before we can submit this script. Can you guess what they are?

> ## Change #1
> Specify your **project**.
>
> Use the ```-P``` PBS directive to specify the _**Training**_ project, using its _short name_.
> ~~~
> #PBS -P Training
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
{: .solution}

> ## Change #2
> Give your job a **name**
>
> Use the ```-N``` PBS directive to give your job an easily identifiable name. You might run **lots** of jobs at the same time, so you want to be able to keep track of them!
> ~~~
> #PBS -N Index_hayim
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> Substitute a job name of your choice!
{: .solution}

> ## Change #3
> Tailor your **resource** requests.
>
> Use the ```-l``` PBS directive to request appropriate compute **resources** and **wall-time** for your job.
>
> This script will not be asked to do much, as it'll just be a first test, so request just **1 minute** of wall-time, and the minimum RAM, **1 GB**.
> ~~~
> #PBS -l select=1:ncpus=1:mem=1GB
> #PBS -l walltime=00:01:00
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
{: .solution}

> ## Change #4
> Specify a **job queue**.
>
> Use the ```-q``` PBS directive to send the job to the **defaultQ** queue. You can also try **small-express** if you like; whose jobs start sooner?
> ~~~
> #PBS -q defaultQ
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
{: .solution}


> ## Optional: Set up email notification
> Set up **email notification** for your job.
>
> Use the ```-M``` and ```-m``` PBS directive to specify a destination email address, and the events you wish to be notified about. You can receive notifications for when your job **(b)**egins, **(e)**nds or **(a)**borts.
> ~~~
> #PBS -M hayim.dar@sydney.edu.au
> #PBS -m abe
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
{: .solution}

To begin, we're going to run a very simple 'test' job, so <u>delete everything below the directives</u>, from ```# Load modules``` onward, and replace with

~~~
cd /project/Training/<YourName>

mkdir New_job
cp basic.pbs New_job/copy.pbs
perl hello.pl <YourName>
~~~
{: .bash}

PBS uses your **/home/<unikey>** directory as your default _working directory_ in which to start all PBS scripts. Since your data is not likely to ever be in your home directory, the first command in any script will probably involve setting or changing to the correct folder.

The rest of these commands (i) create a new folder, (ii) make a copy of the **basic.pbs** file, and (iii) run a '_Perl_' script using the ```perl``` programming language and interpreter. The script **hello.pl** accepts one argument.

Save this PBS script (on nano <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd>), and exit the editor (on nano <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd>).

### Submitting PBS scripts to Artemis

Finally, submit the PBS script **basic.pbs** to the Artemis scheduler, using ```qsub```:

~~~
qsub basic.pbs
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[jdar4135@login3 hayim]$ qsub basic.pbs
2556851.pbsserver
~~~
{: .output}

Congratulations, you have now submitted your first Artemis job! :tada::tada:

## Monitoring Artemis jobs

### qstat

You've submitted a job, but how can you check what it's doing, if it's finished, and what it's done?

Note that when we submitted our PBS script above, we received the feedback

~~~
2557008.pbsserver
~~~
{: .output}

This number, **XXXXXX.pbsserver** is the **job ID** number for this job, and is how we can track its status.

We can query a current Artemis job using the PBS command ```qstat``` and the **job ID**. The flag ```-x``` will give us job info for historical jobs, so include it to see our job even if it has already completed

~~~
qstat -x 2557008
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[jdar4135@login3 hayim]$ qstat -x 2557008
Job id            Name             User              Time Use S Queue
----------------  ---------------- ----------------  -------- - -----
2557008.pbsserver Index_hayim      jdar4135                 0 Q small
~~~
{: .output}

**qstat** shows that my job, **2556851.pbsserver**, with the name I gave it, **Index_hayim**, is currently _queued_ in the **small** job queue. The _**job status**_ column ```S``` shows whether a job is **(Q)**ueued, **(R)**unning, **(E)**xiting, **(H)**eld, **(F)**ininshed, or is a **(B)**atch array job. More status codes can be found in the docs (```man qstat```).

**qstat** has many other options. Some common ones are:

| Flag | Option |
|:--:|---|
| ```-T``` | show an _estimated Start Time_ for jobs |
| ```-w``` | print wider output columns, for when your job names are longe than 10 characters |
| ```-u``` | show jobs for a specific _user_ (Unikey) |
| ```-x``` | show finished jobs also |
| ```-f``` | show full job details |
| ```-Q``` | print out numbers of jobs queued and running in for all of Artemis' job queues |

Print out the entire job list, by not specifying a **job ID**, with estimated start times, by running ```qstat -T```. How far down are our training jobs?

#### jobstat

Artemis provides another tool for checking your jobs, which also shows some extra information about Artemis. This is ```jobstat```:

~~~
[jdar4135@login3 hayim]$ jobstat

~~~
[jdar4135@login3 hayim]$ cat Index_hayim.o2557008

The output from the **hello.pl** script appears in the PBS output log as expected.

Finally, let's have a look at the resource **usage** report

### Did what we expected happen?

The final test of whether a job ran correctly is to check whether the outputs you were expecting to be produced actually were produced. In our case, the script **basic.pbs** was meant to create a new folder and copy itself into it. We have already seen that **hello.pl** was run successfuly, so check for the rest:

Our ```ls``` command earlier revealed that the new folder was successfully created
~~~

When you're done, save the script (on nano <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd>), and exit (on nano <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd>).

Submit the job as before, with ```qsub```

~~~
qsub index.pbs
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[jdar4135@login3 hayim]$ qsub align.pbs
2557080.pbsserver
~~~
{: .output}


<!-- Have a look at the _full output_ from ```qstat```

~~~
qstat -f 2557080
~~~
{: .bash}

There's a lot. Let's ```grep``` just a few lines:

~~~
qstat -f 2557080 | grep -e ""
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~

~~~
{: .output}

The line -->

We mentioned above that we requested 2 CPUs. How did we make us of them? Have a look at the _program call_ for ```bwa mem```<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

~~~
bwa mem -M -t 2 -R '@RG\tID:134\tPL:illumina\tPU:CONNEACXX\tSM:MS_134' \
    ${io}/canfam3_chr5.fasta ${io}/134_R1.fastq.gz  \
    ${io}/134_R2.fastq.gz | samtools view -bSho ${io}/134.bam -
~~~
{: .bash}

What do those option flags do? Are any relevant here? Check the help or manual page for ```bwa```.

> ## Answer
> The ```bwa mem``` help instructions lists the ```-t``` flag as setting the number of _threads_. Multi-threading is a requirement for any program wanting to use more than one CPU core.
>
> On Artemis, the default is to run one thread per core, so selecting ```-t 2``` threads will lead Artemis to use **2 CPU cores**, if at least this many are requested.

Has your **align.pbs** job completed yet? Check for errors

~~~
grep -se "Exit Status" *
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[jdar4135@login3 hayim]$ grep -se "Exit Status" *
Align_hayim.o2557080_usage:Exit Status: 0
Index_hayim.o2557008_usage:Exit Status: 0
Index_hayim.o2557043_usage:Exit Status: 0
~~~
{: .output}

Great. However, note again that the **error log** is full of messages -- none though are actual errors. You could try searching for the word 'error' in the error log using ```grep``` as well, and see that it is empty -- however, we have no guarantee that the program authors would use the word 'error' in their error messages. Add the ```-i``` flag to make your search case _insensitive_:

~~~
[jdar4135@login2 hayim]$ grep -ie error Align_hayim.e2557080
~~~
{: .output}

As before, check the resource usage log

~~~
cat Align_hayim.o2557080_usage
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[jdar4135@login2 hayim]$ cat Align_hayim.o2557080_usage

-- WARNINGS ----------------------------------------------------------

** Low Walltime utilisation.  While this may be normal, it may help to check the
** following:
**   Did the job parameters specify more walltime than necessary? Requesting
**   lower walltime could help your job to start sooner.
**   Did your analysis complete as expected or did it crash before completing?
**   Did the application run more quickly than it should have? Is this analysis
**   the one you intended to run?
**
** Low Memory utilisation on hpc018. While this may be normal, it may help to check
** the following:
**   Did the job parameters specify too much memory? Requesting less RAM could
**   help your job to start sooner.
**   Did you use MPI and was the work distributed correctly? Correcting this
**   could allow your job to run using less RAM in each chunk.
**   Did your analysis complete as expected or did it crash before completing?
**   Did the application use less RAM than it should have? Is this analysis the
**   one you intended to run?
**

{: .output}


This is better resource utilisation: we used **45% of our walltime**, **77% CPU**, and **55% of our RAM**. We could trim our requests further, but walltime can vary for similar data depending on the algorithm, and providing too little memory (unlike too few CPUs) can cause a job to _fail_. So err on the side of caution.
