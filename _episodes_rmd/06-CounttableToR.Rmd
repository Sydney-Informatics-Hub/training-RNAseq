The STAR-generated count table is called `DATASETNAME_ReadsPerGene.out.tab`. We can download it from our HPC server, load it into R, and explore it using standard R libraries.

First, create an R project using RStudio, by selecting `File -> New Project...` from the menu. Then follow the screenshots below:


![rstudioproject](../fig/rstudioproject.png)

After you've done this, you should see 

To download the data from the server, open another terminal window on your machine and enter:

```
cd 
scp yourusername@hpc.sydney.edu.au:/project/Training/yourname/star/*ReadsPerGene.out.tab .
```
